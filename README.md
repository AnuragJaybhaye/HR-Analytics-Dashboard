I’ve always been passionate about how data can tell a story and solve real-world problems 🌍. I came across a fascinating HR analytics dataset online that included a case study with a clear set of challenges: how to best allocate a $1000 wellness bonus, calculate a specific wage increase for non-smokers from a $983,221 insurance budget, and, most importantly, uncover the hidden patterns behind employee absenteeism.
I saw this as the perfect opportunity to challenge myself 💪. I decided to take on the role of a BI Analyst and build a complete project from scratch, aiming to solve every problem presented in the case study.

**Step 1: Making Sense of the Data with SQL**

The provided data was raw and split across multiple files—an employee list, absence logs, and reasons for absence 📂. Before any analysis was possible, I needed to bring order to this chaos.
I rolled up my sleeves and got to work with SQL 💻. I wrote a series of queries to clean the information, correcting inconsistencies and formatting errors. Then, I carefully joined the different tables, linking each absence record to the specific employee and the reason provided. This process was like assembling a puzzle 🧩; by the end of it, I had created a clean, unified, and analysis-ready dataset. This was the bedrock of the entire project.

**Step 2: Bringing the Story to Life with Power BI**

With a solid data foundation in place, I moved into Power BI 🚀. The case study included a wireframe, which I used as my blueprint 🗺️. My goal wasn't just to create static charts, but to build an interactive tool that could dynamically answer the questions posed in the case study.
I began by creating visuals like donut charts to see the employee breakdown and line charts to track absence trends. To tackle the specific budget calculations, I wrote my own DAX measures ➕➖. One of the key formulas I developed calculated the precise $0.68/hr wage increase for all non-smoking employees, directly addressing one of the core tasks.

**Step 3: The "Aha!" Moments**

This was the most rewarding part of the project 🌟. As the dashboard came together and I started interacting with it, the story in the data began to emerge.
The patterns were striking 🎯. A line chart immediately revealed a significant spike in absences every Monday 🗓️. Another chart showed that absenteeism wasn't steady throughout the year but had clear peaks in the spring and mid-summer months. By drilling down into the reasons for absence, it became obvious that "Medical consultation" was the leading cause. The data was no longer just a collection of rows; it was a living story of workplace behavior.

**The Result**

The final result was a fully interactive dashboard that successfully solved every challenge laid out in the original case study ✅.
For me, this project was a powerful hands-on experience. It allowed me to manage an entire analytics workflow—from raw data to actionable insight—and solidified my skills in using SQL and Power BI to transform a complex business problem into a clear, visual solution 💡.

**Here is the final Dashboard**
