# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I’ve always been passionate about how data can tell a story and solve real-world problems. I came across a fascinating HR analytics dataset online that included a case study with a clear set of challenges: how to best allocate a $1000 wellness bonus, calculate a specific wage increase for non-smokers from a $983,221 insurance budget, and, most importantly, uncover the hidden patterns behind employee absenteeism.

I saw this as the perfect opportunity to challenge myself. I decided to take on the role of a BI Analyst and build a complete project from scratch, aiming to solve every problem presented in the case study.

Step 1: Making Sense of the Data with SQL
The provided data was raw and split across multiple files—an employee list, absence logs, and reasons for absence. Before any analysis was possible, I needed to bring order to this chaos.
My first step was to get hands-on with SQL. I wrote a series of queries to clean the data, correcting formatting issues and ensuring consistency. Then, I performed the crucial step of joining the tables to create a single, unified dataset. This process was like assembling a puzzle, and it resulted in a clean, reliable master table that would serve as the foundation for my entire analysis.

Step 2: Bringing the Story to Life with Power BI
With a solid data foundation in place, I moved into Power BI. The case study included a wireframe, which I used as my blueprint. My goal wasn't just to create static charts, but to build an interactive tool that could dynamically answer the questions posed in the case study.
I began by creating visuals like donut charts to see the employee breakdown and line charts to track absence trends. To tackle the specific budget calculations, I wrote my own DAX measures. One of the key formulas I developed calculated the precise $0.68/hr wage increase for all non-smoking employees, directly addressing one of the core tasks.

Step 3: The "Aha!" Moments
This was the most rewarding part of the project. As the dashboard came together and I started interacting with it, the story in the data began to emerge.
The patterns were striking. A line chart immediately revealed a significant spike in absences every Monday. Another chart showed that absenteeism wasn't steady throughout the year but had clear peaks in the spring and mid-summer months. By drilling down into the reasons for absence, it became obvious that "Medical consultation" was the leading cause. The data was no longer just a collection of rows; it was a living story of workplace behavior.

The Result
The final result was a fully interactive dashboard that successfully solved every challenge laid out in the original case study. It could filter data, showcase trends, and provide the exact financial calculations required.
For me, this project was a powerful hands-on experience. It allowed me to manage an entire analytics workflow—from raw data to actionable insight—and solidified my skills in using SQL and Power BI to transform a complex problem into a clear, visual solution.
